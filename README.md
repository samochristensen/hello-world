# hello-world
First Experience with GitHub

I am an Electrical Engineering Student at Utah State University. In the future I plan to work as a patent attorney and to help inspire people to grow and invent. To gain the experience and aptitude to build the world through inspiring those around me. Be a person worthy of trust and respect that others will look to for leadership and counsel.
